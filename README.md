# Task 6 – Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
The goal of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, test multiple passwords using strength checking tools, and learn best practices for secure password creation.

## Tools Used
- https://password.kaspersky.com/
- https://passwordmeter.com/
- https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/

## Steps Performed
1. Created multiple passwords with different complexity:
   - Only lowercase
   - With uppercase letters
   - With numbers
   - With special symbols
   - Long passphrase style password

2. Tested each password on password strength checker websites.

3. Observed:
   - Strength score
   - How long it takes to crack
   - Improvement suggestions

4. Noted best practices for strong password creation.

## Password Test Results (Examples)
| Password | Length | Type | Crack Time | Rating |
|---------|--------|------|------------|--------|
| hello123 | 8 | Weak | Few seconds | ❌ Weak |
| Hello@123 | 9 | Mix | Hours | ⚠ Medium |
| Rk@2025#Secure | 14 | Strong mix | Millions of years | ✔ Strong |
| LongPassPhraseIsBetter@2025 | 25 | Passphrase | Impossible for brute force | 🔒 Very Strong |

## Best Practices Learned
- Use **12–16+ characters**
- Use mix of:
  - Uppercase (A–Z)
  - Lowercase (a–z)
  - Numbers (0–9)
  - Symbols (!@#$%)
- Avoid common words
- Never use personal info (DOB, name, mobile)
- Use **Passphrases** like: `Sunset$River@2025Flows`
- Use **Password Manager**
- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

## Common Password Attacks Researched
- Keylogger attack
- Brute force attack
- Dictionary attack
- Phishing attack
- Password reuse attacks

## Conclusion
By testing multiple passwords, I learned how complexity and length improve security.  
Strong passwords protect accounts from hacking attacks and should always be combined with MFA for better safety.
